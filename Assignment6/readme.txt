Assignment 6

Degree of success: 100%

linker.c is capable of linking several object files into either a resolved
executable file or an unresolved consolidated object file with the -o option.
The executable can be built using the included Makefile, and all the assembly
source code can be found in the AddInts folder. For this project I started by
building the linker source code which has a similar functionality as the
masm_mrd source code. I then divided my assembly source code from the last
assignment into several source files to make use of the linker.

For AddInts.exe use command:    make AddInts.exe
For AddInts.o use command:      make AddInts.o
