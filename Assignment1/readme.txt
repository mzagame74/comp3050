Assignment 1

Degree of success: 100%

This program demos and takes user input of five floating point numbers and breaks it down into hex and binary string values. I used the code provided that stored the bits of certain floating point numbers in a union of bit fields as a starting point. I then incorporated this code into a loop that runs 10 times to display the 5 demo numbers and 5 user supplied numbers. After the first 5 numbers are displayed, the loop updates the union's bit fields based on scanf float input to print the output. I believe that I was able to correctly acquire the right bits to print the hex and bit string values for the sign, exponent and mantissa of a floating point number. I did not encounter any issues with this program.
