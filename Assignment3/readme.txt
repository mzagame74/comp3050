Assignment 3

Degree of success: 100%

rfib.asm is a recursive implementation of the fibonacci sequence in mic1 assembly language.
After building the assembly code with the build commands found in build.txt, the program
looks to memory locations 100-105 for input data then recursively calls the fib function to
process that data on the stack until the fibonacci result is returned. I did not encounter 
any problems with this assignment.
